# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Local Data Persistence System provides offline-first data storage for the Idea Sharing app using Hive as the local database. This system enables users to store, retrieve, and manage their ideas and room information locally on their device, ensuring the app works seamlessly without internet connectivity. The system supports the core philosophy of local-first data storage while preparing for future real-time synchronization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my ideas to be automatically saved locally on my device, so that I can access them offline and never lose my thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new idea THEN the system SHALL persist the idea to local storage immediately
2. WHEN a user modifies an existing idea THEN the system SHALL update the local storage with the changes
3. WHEN a user deletes an idea THEN the system SHALL remove it from local storage
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load all stored ideas from local storage
5. IF the device has no internet connection THEN the system SHALL still allow full CRUD operations on ideas

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my room information to be stored locally, so that I can quickly access my recent rooms and rejoin them easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or joins a room THEN the system SHALL store the room information locally
2. WHEN a user leaves a room THEN the system SHALL update the room's last active timestamp
3. WHEN a room expires (2 months inactive) THEN the system SHALL mark it as archived but retain local data
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load all room information from local storage
5. IF a room has a password THEN the system SHALL securely store the password locally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle different types of ideas (text, images, URLs) with appropriate storage mechanisms, so that all my content is preserved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a text idea THEN the system SHALL store the text content directly in the database
2. WHEN a user saves an image idea THEN the system SHALL store the image URL and metadata
3. WHEN a user saves a URL idea THEN the system SHALL store the URL and any extracted metadata
4. WHEN retrieving ideas THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate data structure for each idea type
5. IF an idea contains multiple content types THEN the system SHALL handle mixed content appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the data models to support future real-time synchronization, so that the local storage can integrate with collaborative features later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing ideas THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for creation and modification
2. WHEN storing ideas THEN the system SHALL include unique identifiers suitable for synchronization
3. WHEN storing room data THEN the system SHALL include fields necessary for real-time collaboration
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for conflict resolution
5. IF synchronization is implemented later THEN the local storage SHALL support merge operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be organized and searchable, so that I can quickly find specific ideas or rooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing ideas THEN the system SHALL support indexing by creation date, content type, and room association
2. WHEN querying ideas THEN the system SHALL provide efficient filtering by date ranges, types, and rooms
3. WHEN searching ideas THEN the system SHALL support text-based search across idea content
4. WHEN retrieving rooms THEN the system SHALL sort by last active date by default
5. IF the database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable query performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be backed up and restorable, so that I don't lose my ideas if something happens to my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for data export
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL validate and merge imported ideas without duplicates
3. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or provide error information
4. WHEN migrating app versions THEN the system SHALL handle database schema migrations automatically
5. IF the database becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to preserve data
