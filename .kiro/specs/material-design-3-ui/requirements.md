# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Material Design 3 Standards UI system provides a comprehensive implementation of Google's Material Design 3 (Material You) design system for the Idea Sharing app. This system ensures consistent, accessible, and modern user interface components that follow Material Design 3 principles including dynamic color theming, improved accessibility, and enhanced user experience patterns. The implementation will create reusable UI components that adapt to user preferences and system settings while maintaining design consistency across the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to follow Material Design 3 visual standards, so that I have a familiar and polished user experience consistent with modern Android applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL apply Material Design 3 color schemes and typography
2. WHEN displaying UI components THEN the system SHALL use Material Design 3 component specifications
3. WHEN users interact with elements THEN the system SHALL provide Material Design 3 interaction patterns
4. WHEN the app renders on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL follow Material Design 3 responsive guidelines
5. IF the system supports dark mode THEN the system SHALL implement Material Design 3 dark theme specifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to support dynamic color theming based on my system wallpaper, so that the interface feels personalized and integrated with my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system supports dynamic color THEN the app SHALL extract and apply colors from the user's wallpaper
2. WHEN dynamic colors are not available THEN the app SHALL fall back to predefined Material Design 3 color palettes
3. WHEN the user changes their wallpaper THEN the app SHALL update its color scheme accordingly
4. WHEN applying dynamic colors THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
5. IF the user prefers static colors THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable dynamic theming

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to implement Material Design 3 color theory principles, so that the interface uses harmonious color relationships and maintains visual consistency across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL use Material Design 3 color roles (primary, secondary, tertiary, error, neutral, neutral variant)
2. WHEN generating color palettes THEN the system SHALL implement Material Design 3 tonal palettes with proper tonal values (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99, 100)
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use semantic color tokens (surface, on-surface, surface-variant, outline) for consistent meaning
4. WHEN creating color schemes THEN the system SHALL ensure proper color harmony using Material Design 3 color algorithms
5. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN the system SHALL maintain color relationships and semantic meaning
6. IF custom brand colors are used THEN the system SHALL generate complementary tonal palettes that follow Material Design 3 color theory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements to provide clear visual feedback and follow accessibility standards, so that the app is usable by everyone including users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide Material Design 3 state feedback (pressed, focused, disabled)
2. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
3. WHEN users navigate with assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic labels and navigation
4. WHEN touch targets are presented THEN the system SHALL meet minimum 48dp touch target sizes
5. IF users have motion sensitivity THEN the system SHALL respect reduced motion preferences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive component library following Material Design 3 specifications, so that I can build consistent interfaces efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built Material Design 3 components
2. WHEN customizing components THEN the system SHALL maintain Material Design 3 design tokens and specifications
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have documented component usage guidelines
4. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
5. IF custom components are needed THEN the system SHALL provide base classes that follow Material Design 3 patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and meaningful animations that enhance the user experience, so that interactions feel natural and provide visual continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL use Material Design 3 transition patterns
2. WHEN elements appear or disappear THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate Material Design 3 motion curves
3. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL use subtle animations that don't distract from content
4. WHEN users have reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL minimize or disable animations
5. IF animations impact performance THEN the system SHALL optimize or simplify motion effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and readable typography throughout the app that follows Material Design 3 standards, so that content is easy to read and visually hierarchical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text content THEN the system SHALL use Material Design 3 typography scale (Display, Headline, Title, Body, Label)
2. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate font weights, sizes, and line heights according to Material Design 3 specifications
3. WHEN showing different content types THEN the system SHALL use semantic typography roles (e.g., displayLarge for hero text, bodyMedium for content)
4. WHEN text needs emphasis THEN the system SHALL use Material Design 3 typography variants (Medium, Small, Large) appropriately
5. WHEN supporting multiple languages THEN the system SHALL ensure typography scales work with different character sets and reading directions
6. IF custom fonts are used THEN the system SHALL maintain Material Design 3 typography principles and fallback to system fonts when unavailable

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to adapt its layout and components to different screen sizes and orientations, so that I have an optimal experience on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL apply Material Design 3 responsive breakpoints
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts appropriately
3. WHEN displaying content on large screens THEN the system SHALL utilize space efficiently with proper component scaling
4. WHEN running on foldable devices THEN the system SHALL handle screen transitions gracefully
5. IF the device has unique form factors THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and visual hierarchy
